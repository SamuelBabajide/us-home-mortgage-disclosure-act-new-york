-- General analysis section 9: what borrowing costs.
-- Restricted to 2025 and to originated loans. Both restrictions are load
-- bearing. A rate exists only on a loan that was actually made, and the median
-- rate moved from 4.375 percent in 2022 to 6.875 in 2024, so pooling the four
-- years would measure the rate environment rather than the product.
-- The median uses percentile_disc rather than percentile_cont. Mortgage rates and
-- rate spreads are quoted in eighths of a point, so interpolating between the two
-- middle loans of an even-sized group returns a price no borrower was charged.
-- It is also the one construct in this project where PostgreSQL and DuckDB can
-- legitimately disagree: interpolation is floating point, and on one group of 288
-- loans the two engines landed either side of the third decimal. percentile_disc
-- returns an observed value by position, so it is exact in both.
