-- Disparity analysis section 4: the sex by race funnel.
-- This sat in the general analysis until it was moved here, which is where it
-- belongs: the general phase describes the market, and any cut that crosses
-- applicant race is part of the disparity question, not part of the market.
-- Descriptive even so. What survives controlling for income, product,
-- neighbourhood and lender is queries 16 to 25b.
